 * How a navigator jump moves, and how to tell when it has stopped.

 * Two facts drive this. A jump should glide — the Gemini timeline always has —
 * unless the reader asked for less motion. And the navigator's homing loop,
 * which re-aims after content mounts or re-measures, fires on a short timer; if
 * it lands while a long smooth scroll is still travelling it reads a position
 * mid-flight and jumps again, which looks worse than never animating at all.
 * So the caller waits for the scroll to settle before homing.
